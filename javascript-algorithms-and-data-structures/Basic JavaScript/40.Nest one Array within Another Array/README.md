# Nest one Array within Another Array

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

```javascript
const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
```

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called `myArray`.

## Tests

`myArray` should have at least one array nested within another array.
