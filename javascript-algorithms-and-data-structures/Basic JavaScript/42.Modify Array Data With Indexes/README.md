# Modify Array Data With Indexes

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

```javascript
// Setup
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];

// Only change code below this line
myArray[0] = 45;
```

myArray should now be [45, 64, 99].

You should be using correct index to modify the value in myArray.
