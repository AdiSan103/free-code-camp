# Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

```javascript
myVar = myVar - 5;
```

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar -= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

## Tests

`a` should equal `5`.

`b` should equal `-6`.

`c` should equal `2`.

You should use the `-=` operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
