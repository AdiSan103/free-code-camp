# Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

Like the `+=` operator, `-=` subtracts a number from a variable.

```javascript
myVar = myVar * 5;
```

will subtract `5 `from `myVar`. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar *= 5;
```

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.

## Tests

`a` should equal `25`.

`b` should equal `36`.

`c` should equal `46`.

You should use the `*=` operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
