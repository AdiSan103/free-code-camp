# Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (`=`).It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

```javascript
var myVar = 0;
```

Creates a new variable called `myVar` and assigns it an initial value of `0`.
Define a variable `a` with `var` and initialize it to a value of `9`
